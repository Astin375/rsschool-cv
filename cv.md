## About me
I'm currently working as Data Processing Specialist at EPAM Systems. My duties mostly consist of routine work, such as reporting, creating/updating presentations with little amount of data analysis. Being a curious and sometimes even inquisitive person, I always pay high attention to details and look for ways to improving my work. Front-end development is a new and unknown field for me, but my goal is to constantly study and grow as a professional.
